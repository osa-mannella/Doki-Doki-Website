        <p><b>Doki Doki Literature Club is a horror game released in 2017. It was built and produced by Dan Salvato having been started in 2015. In this overview we will be going over all 4 acts of the game and the possible endings in which the player can encounter when playing the game. Below I have outlined all the characters of DDLC (Doki Doki Literature Club.) You can navigate to the different parts of the page with the buttons below (story contains spoilers.)</b></p>

            <a href="https://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Monika" target="_blank"><img src="images/monika.png" alt="Picture of Monika" height="400px" class="monika"></a><p style="float: left; float: top;">Monika is the president of the literature club<br> The character who you play knows her from<br> around the school. Throughout the game we<br> are given little chance to interact with Monika.<br> Her name is the only name which does not<br> end in an I and she is the only girl wearing<br> black socks, all this things combined set her<br> apart from the others and show that she is<br> different from the other characters we see<br> in DDLC. She is one of the fan favorites<br> and has several fan made games involving<br> her. Monika is certainly the most unique<br> characters and I personally think that she<br> has the most depth and characteristc<br> compared to the other characters in DDLC.</p>

She is the girl who invites us<br> to the literature club. She is always<br> caring for others and puts a smile<br> on everyones face. She is the vice<br> president of the literature club.<br> Sayori has chin-length hair which is<br> curled at the end. She wears a pink<br> full length t-shirt at home and the <br>basic school uniform during school<br> hours.</p></div>

            <a href="https://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Yuri" target="_blank"><img src="images/yuri.png" alt="Picture of Yuri" height="400px" style="float: left;"></a><p>Yuri one of the more shy members of the Literature club.<br>She adores reading, in particular she liked fantasy books<br>She is the tallest girl in the group and is also a fan favorite.<br> She likes dark things and has an obsession with knives with<br> a collection of different blades. During school she wears the<br> school uniform however outside of school she wears a white<br> sweater. She has purple hair which curls inwards at the ends.<br> She is 5'5" and appears in Acts 1, 2 and 4. Her eyes are a<br> light purple colour similar to her hair. She attempts to be<br> generous at all times and not be pushy when there is no need.<br> She is 18 years of age (so are all the other girls in the game.)<br> and her character file is named yuri.chr in the game files.</p></div>
            <!--<a href="https://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Natsuki" target="_blank"><img src="images/natsuki.png" alt="Picture of Natsuki" height="400px" class="natsuki"></a><p style="position: absolute; left: 900px;">Natsuki is one of the shorter<br> members of the group being<br>only 4'11. She loves cute things<br> aswell as baking. She has pink<br> hair and can come accross as<br> mean, however she is soft inside<br> and loves manga. Her character<br> is very simple and consists of<br> very simple qualities. I find her<br> a bit boring and has little to discover<br> when you begin to learn more about her.</p>-->
